Ejercicio basico de repositorio

cada vez que quiera guardar una version voy a 
subirlo al area stage que solo de deja en memoria
luego al repositorio definitivamente

If I want to save someone version of my project
I must get up to stage area first. But it stays only in 
memory. For to get in it into the repository I have use
the commit command. I have remembered to write a 
commentary for to know which is the changes 
what I want to save in this new version.

Now, we will try to learn how to be an expert to setting our 
different branches. Be careful, we must dominate the 
checkout command, and the reset and brnch comman too.
